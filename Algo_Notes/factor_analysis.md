# Asset Pricing with Factor Models,

**I. Capital Asset Pricing Model(CAPM)**

  Core Assumptions:
- Investors are risk-averse, utility maximizing, rational.
- Choices are based on expected return and normality.
- One period market window.
- Homogenous outlook, no private information.
- Borrow and lend at risk-free rate.
- Market are frictionless and investment can be infinitely divisible. 

In equilibrium, the best portfolio must be the market portfolio that every participants tends to hold.
Such, a Security Market Line formed to represent how individual securities are priced. SML represents such tradeoff between Expected return and Market Risk(beta).

注意，仅有系统性市场风险beta在资产组合中被定价了。这与基本假设相呼应，因为一切非系统性风险都可以通过分散性投资分化和消除，所以不应被”定价“。

  Core Remarks:
- All individuals hold a portfolio along the CML, with combination of Rf and M.
- All firm-specific risk(non-systematic) risk can be diversifed away and thus not priced.
- All invidual securities are priced based purely on its market risk(as measured in beta/covariance with market), not the total volatility risk. 

基本的CAPM定价模型对任何“非市场择时者”，“选股者”来说是最完美的模型，个人投资者只需要依照自己的风险偏好选取一个风险合理分化的资产组合。
