# Asset Pricing with Factor Models,

**I. Capital Asset Pricing Model(CAPM)**

  Core Assumptions:
- Investors are risk-averse, utility maximizing, rational.
- Choices are based on expected return and normality.
- One period market window.
- Homogenous outlook, no private information.
- Borrow and lend at risk-free rate.
- Market are frictionless and investment can be infinitely divisible. 

In equilibrium, the best portfolio must be the market portfolio that every participants tends to hold.
Such, a Security Market Line formed to represent how individual securities are priced. SML represents such tradeoff between Expected return and Market Risk(beta).

注意，仅有系统性市场风险beta在资产组合中被定价了。这与基本假设相呼应，因为一切非系统性风险都可以通过分散性投资分化和消除，所以不应被”定价“。
