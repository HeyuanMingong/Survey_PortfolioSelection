	In recent years, machine learning has been applied to various applications in finance (Gy¨orfi et al.,
2012), including On-line Portfolio Selection, which aims to sequentially allocate capital among a
set of assets, such that the investment return can be maximized in the long run (Kelly, 1956). It
has attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry, and several machine learning
algorithms have been proposed (Li and Hoi, 2014), including traditional algorithms (Cover, 1991;
Helmbold et al., 1998; Agarwal et al., 2006; Borodin et al., 2004; Gy¨orfi et al., 2006, 2008), and
recent state-of-the-art online learning algorithms (Li et al., 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015). Unlike other
application domains in machine learning where various open-source packages are available, very
few open-source toolkits exist for on-line portfolio selection, primarily due to the confidential
nature of financial industry. Consequently, it is difficult for researchers to evaluate new algorithms
for comprehensive comparisons with existing ones.
